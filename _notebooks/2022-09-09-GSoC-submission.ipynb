    "## 1 The gap - why we need conditional autoregressive models in PyMC \n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional autoregressive (CAR) models are a class of spatial and spatio-temporal models that are commonly used in areas such as disease mapping and for inference within large datasets. They are amenable to use with large datasetys due to the often low-order \"autoregressive\" structure used to model the dependence between observations. For example, within a spatial CAR model, the spatial dependence of an area on other areas is often modelled as dependent on only the direct neighbours of that area. This induces a sparsity in the precision matrix between these spatial effects, ensuring more efficient inference than if the precision matrix was dense. Currently, packages such as [CARBayesST](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CARBayesST/index.html), [Nimble](https://r-nimble.org/), and [INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/) support a wide variety of CAR models. However, CARBayesST and Nimble use samplers such as random-walk MCMC, which often suffer from either poor convergence or low effective sample size. INLA uses a series of numerical optimization routines to offer a fast approximation to the posterior, yet can be known to occassionally have poor accuracy. \n",

    "where $j\\sim i$ indicates the all neighbours of $i$, $n_i$ is the total number of neighbours for area $i$, and $\\alpha\\in(0, 1)$, $\\tau^2$ are free. In practice the parameter $\\alpha$ is difficult to estimate and the CAR prior is rarely used as part of a more complex statistical model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Currently, PyMC has a `CAR` distribution, and an open pull request for an `ICAR` distribution here. As it currently stands within the pull request for the `ICAR` distribution, the test coverage of the `logp` function is poor, and hence why the pull request has not been merged. The reason for the poor testing covergage is that the implementation of the `ICAR` distribution is based off of a singular Gaussian distribution, making it difficult to write tests for the `logp` with a different construction to the implementation of the distribution itself. Currently there exists no tutorial using the `pm.CAR` distribution as it currently stands within PyMC. Please see ongoing progress in [this pull request](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-examples/pull/417).\n",
